  Multiple ethylen pumps system simulation. 
  
  This is a project of real-time programin that simulates a real system of a real company.
  The simulation can controle the condition of the valves, and the pumps react automatically turning ON/OFF in case of danger.
  It was designed to protect the pumps in case of failure measuring the flux and the preasure.
  
  Compile and run the program. Open the .txt and change the valves to change the pumps interaction.
